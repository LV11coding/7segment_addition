### This code checks for overlapping numbers in given row in a 2D array. <br/>
### If there is even a single number overlapping, the code returns false. <br/>
### 0s are indications for no element in this position. <br/>
In my code I use this so I can check if any two numbers on the 7 segment display can combine to cover the whole display without any parts overlapping. <br/>
